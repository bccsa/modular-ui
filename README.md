A data-first, parent-child structured javascript front-end framework

### Notifying property changes
On control creation through SetData(), properties not starting with "_" of boolean, string, number or array types are automatically equipped with getters and setters. The setters fires an event with the property name and updated value when the property value is set.
The property values are stored in the control._properties object.

SetData also triggers the Update(propertyName) override function when a property is set. This is however depreciated, and the events generated by the setters should be used instead to handle property value changes.

```javascript
this.on('propertyName', val => {
    // implementing logic to handle value change
})
```

## Known Issues
* Child components not loading on insecure (http) sites (tested on Chrome, Edge 107). This is due to the MutationObserver not observing changes to the DOM. It however works correcly when hosted locally or via https.
